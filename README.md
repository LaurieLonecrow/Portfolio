This is my Portfolio website that I plan to use to apply for jobs as well as show off my work to potential clients.  I began by drawing out the artboards using Sketch. I used ejs templating and node.js to structure my files.  I am experimenting with animation and using libraries.  At this point, I am using GSAP and THREE to achieve the initial logo animation and the horizontal scroll in the Design Board pages.
